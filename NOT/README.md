Not Specification
=================

Description:
------------
The NOT gate has an input and an output. If the input is 1, the output is 0 and vice versa. Therefore the NOT gate simply negates its input.
Like any other element NOT gates can be build by using NAND gates. Check out the NAND specification.


Interface Specification:
------------------------
Inputs: in;
Outputs: out;
