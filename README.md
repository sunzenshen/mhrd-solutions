MHRD Solutions
==============
My solutions to the NAND to CPU design game [MHRD](http://store.steampowered.com/app/576030/).

Exercise prompts provided by Funghisoft, and extracted from their savestate file format.

For context regarding the exercise of building a CPU design from NAND gates,
I recommend the book [The Elements of Computing Systems](http://www.nand2tetris.org/book.php) by Nisan and Schocken. I've been reading through it as a companion to these exercises, and have found it very helpful and immediately applicable.

The first 6 chapters can be found on the course website for free, and cover the scope that MHRD touches: http://www.nand2tetris.org/course.php

Copyright reserved but frankly not enforced. As with any of these kinds of games, you get out what you put into it, though there's no shame in getting a little help now and then. Feel free to use as you like, just not for homework! In that case, you're better off struggling for sake of the exercise. :)

Enjoy!
